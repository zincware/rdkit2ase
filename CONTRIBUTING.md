# Contribution Guidelines

All contributions are welcome!

Ideally, please open an issue first to discuss the feature or bugfix you plan to
work on. Create a dedicated branch from `main` for your changes and open a pull
request.

To be accepted, your contribution should include tests for any new functionality
and pass all existing tests in the `/tests` directory. We use
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` to ensure consistent code quality - please make sure
all checks pass.

For any further questions, feel free to use the issue tracker to start a
discussion.
