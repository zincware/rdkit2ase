# Summary

The increasing prevalence of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) has shifted requirements for setting up atomistic simulations.
Unlike classical force fields, MLIPs primarily require atomic positions and species, thereby removing the need for predefined topology files used for classical force fields in molecular dynamics software like GROMACS[@abrahamGROMACSHighPerformance2015], LAMMPS[@LAMMPS], ESPResSo[@weikESPResSo40Extensible2019], or OpenMM[@eastmanOpenMM8Molecular2024].
Consequently, the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) [@larsenAtomicSimulationEnvironment2017] has become a popular Python toolkit for handling atomic structures and interfacing with MLIPs, particularly within the materials science and soft matter communities, because it originates from _ab initio_ simulations, which share the same setup as MLIP-driven studies.
In contrast to _ab initio_, MLIPs are much faster and can run on much larger systems, making high throughput simulations of more complex systems feasible and increasing the need for efficient initial structure generation.

Concurrently, RDKit[@landrumRdkitRdkit2023_03_22023] offers extensive functionality for cheminformatics and manipulating chemical structures.
However, standard RDKit workflows are not designed for MLIP-driven simulation, while typical ASE-MLIP workflows may lack rich, explicit chemical information such as bond orders or molecular identities, as well as capabilities for generating different conformations or searching substructures.

The `molify` package bridges this gap, providing an interface between RDKit's chemical structure generation and cheminformatics capabilities and ASE's handling of 3D atomic structures.
Furthermore, `molify` integrates with PACKMOL[@martinezPACKMOLPackageBuilding2009] to facilitate the creation of complex, periodic simulation cells with diverse chemical compositions, all while preserving crucial chemical connectivity information.
In addition, `molify` simplifies the representation of molecular structures as graphs using NetworkX[@hagbergExploringNetworkStructure2008], e.g., enabling traversing or comparing molecular graphs. 
Lastly, the combination of these packages enables selection and manipulation of atomistic structures based on chemical knowledge rather than manual index handling.
While designed for MLIP data, the usage of `molify` is not limited and can be expanded, e.g., by utilizing the bond order information in other ASE-based workflows for classical MD simulations or integrating with machine-learning driven bond order predictions.


# Statement of need
`molify` serves as a vital link between RDKit, ASE, NetworkX, and PACKMOL, designed to aid working with molecular structures in systems without dedicated topology files and formats.
While its core function is to interface these tools, it thereby unlocks new capabilities and significantly reduces the manual coding and data wrangling typically required for preparing and analyzing molecular simulations.
For example, ASE has no tools for handling topological information such as bonds or molecular identities, while RDKit does not natively interface with MLIPs.

`molify` simplifies workflows that previously involved laborious tasks such as sourcing individual structure files from various databases (e.g., the Materials Project[@jainCommentaryMaterialsProject2013] or the ZINC database[@tingleZINC22AFreeMultiBillionScale2023]) and custom setups of simulation cells.
This simplification not only accelerates research but also supports the setup of more complex and chemically diverse simulation scenarios.

One challenge in MLIP-driven simulations is the post-simulation identification and analysis of molecular fragments or chemical changes, as explicit topological information is often absent.
`molify` addresses this by enabling the use of RDKit's powerful SMILES[@weiningerSMILESChemicalLanguage1988]/SMARTS-based substructure searching on ASE structures.
In addition, the resulting molecular graph can be exported to a NetworkX[@hagbergExploringNetworkStructure2008] object for further analysis.
This selection and handling allows for similar functionality as is provided by the MDAnalysis[@gowersMDAnalysisPythonPackage2016] atom selection language, targeted towards simulations with a fixed topology.

# Features and Implementation

The generation of atomic configurations in `molify` is centered around SMILES for defining molecular species.
A typical workflow involves:

1. Generating 3D conformers for individual molecular species from their SMILES using RDKit.
2. Packing these conformers into a simulation box to achieve a target density using PACKMOL and obtaining an ASE Atoms object representing the simulation cell, ready for use with MLIPs.
3. Running MLIP-based simulations using ASE calculators.
4. Post-processing the simulation data by identifying and selecting structures based on SMARTS.

```python
from molify import pack, smiles2conformers
from ase.optimize import LBFGS
from mace.calculators import mace_mp


water = smiles2conformers("O", numConfs=2)
print(water[0].info['connectivity'])
>>> [(0, 1, 1.0), (0, 2, 1.0)] # (atom_idx1, atom_idx2, bond_order)
ethanol = smiles2conformers("CCO", numConfs=5)
density = 1000  # kg/m^3
box = pack([water, ethanol], [7, 5], density)
print(box)
>>> Atoms(symbols='C10H44O12', pbc=True, cell=[8.4, 8.4, 8.4])
box.calc = mace_mp()  # MLIP calculator
opt = LBFGS(box)
opt.run(fmax=0.01)
```
All ASE Atoms objects generated or processed by `molify` store `connectivity` information (bonds and their orders) within the `ase.Atoms.info` dictionary.
If available, `molify` uses this bond information for accurate interconversion.
If an ASE structure is converted to an RDKit molecule without pre-existing connectivity, `molify` leverages RDKit's bond perception algorithms[@kimUniversalStructureConversion2015] to estimate this information.
A representation from both packages is shown in \autoref{fig:zndraw-rdkit}.

```python
from molify import ase2rdkit
from rdkit.Chem import Draw

mol = ase2rdkit(box)
img = Draw.MolToImage(mol)
```

This bidirectional conversion capability allows the use of RDKit's chemical analysis tools together with ASE for MLIP-based simulations.

For instance, if during a simulation, atomic positions in an ASE Atoms object are updated, `molify` can convert this structure back to an RDKit molecule to analyze chemical changes or identify specific substructures.
One common example is the extraction of substructures based on SMILES or SMARTS to track their structure and dynamics within a simulation.
For example, `molify` streamlines the extraction of the CH$_3$ alkyl group from the ethanol molecules inside the simulation cell, without manual index lookup.

```python
from molify import get_substructures

frames: list[ase.Atoms] = get_substructures(
  atoms=box,
  smiles="[C]([H])([H])[H]"
)
```

The OpenBabel[@oboyleOpenBabelOpen2011] package provides similar cheminformatics functionality to RDKit along with extensive file format support.
However, OpenBabel is primarily designed as a format conversion tool with a focus on command-line usage and file I/O, while `molify` is designed for Python-native workflows with in-memory object conversions.
Currently, OpenBabel does not provide direct support for ASE Atoms objects, ASE calculators (including MLIPs), or seamless RDKit-ASE interconversion within Python.
Furthermore, `molify`'s integration with PACKMOL for system building and NetworkX for graph-based molecular analysis provides capabilities beyond OpenBabel's core focus on format conversion.
